Description: Program and data should be separate. 
    Use this package to create a value map file, editing the pairs, and recode variables in a data frame.
    Value mapping can be seen as a surjective, which can yield to a cover, which is often made of tarpaulin, which is often used by a sailor, whom are sometimes pirates, whom are in fictions associated with "treasure map", which is a literal near synonym of a "value map".
    Hence the name.
